Design:
This project analyzes .csv file and generates an output .csv file.
Please check CsvFileAnalyzer_Design_Document.xls for the design explanation.

Improvement:
1. Execution is slow, application will lock due to the long processing (not "Not Responding").
2. Output file has a garbage, maybe because richtextbox has been used.

Tools:
-VisualStudio2019
-C++/CLI so that can use windows form.
